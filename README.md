According to data, the most active time is the beginning and the end of working days so people mostly use bikes to commute from home to work and back.

In addition, the heatmap supports previous data but also adds some more information as the popular time at the weekend is afternoon.

As shown on this graph most customers are male subscribers. So, while we have to target mostly male customers it will be a task for marketing to understand how to attract more female customers.

On this graph we can see that mostly bikes are used for short trips under 10 minutes. There are almost no trips longer than 1 hour. For the future development it should be investigated how to increase trip longevity such as EBikes will make it easier to sell long trips.

On this sheet it can be seen that the most popular areas are downtown and high trafficking areas where  itâ€™s almost impossible to use a personal vehicle.
